Vibe coding with chatgpt to build this addon. Want to have full screenshot functionality for World of Warcraft. Including events such as leveling up and dying, as well as, timed intervals and login events.

Added a default prefix for the screenshots. Defaults to the character name.

Split into multiple files and better folder structure. List out all features and what I want each to do as a function.
